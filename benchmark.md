# VAXP Graph Algorithms Benchmark üöÄ

This document provides performance benchmarks for the algorithms included in the **vaxp_graph** library. The goal is to offer clear, transparent data on how each algorithm performs on various data sizes.

---

## How to Run the Benchmark üßë‚Äçüíª

Any developer can replicate these results on their own machine to verify performance.


1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VAXP/vaxp_graph.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    ```bash
    cd vaxp_graph
    ```

3. **Run the Benchmark Script**
    The project includes a dedicated script to test all algorithms. Run the following command from the project's root directory:

    ```bash
    dart run .benchmark/benchmark.dart
    ```
    

The script will run tests on graphs of 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000 elements (vertices/edges) and print the results to the console.

### **Analysis of Results**

The results clearly demonstrate the practical impact of algorithmic complexity (Big O notation) for graph algorithms.

- **O(V¬≤)** or **O(VE)** algorithms (where V = vertices, E = edges) show a dramatic decrease in performance as the graph size grows by a factor of 10.
- **O(V log V)** or **O(E log V)** algorithms maintain excellent performance, showcasing their suitability for larger graphs.
- **O(V + E)** algorithms remain extremely fast across the board.
